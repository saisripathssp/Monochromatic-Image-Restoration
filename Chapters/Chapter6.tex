\chapter{RESULT AND ANALYSIS}
\section{Model Performance}
The machine learning models were evaluated using various metrics to assess their performance in sentiment analysis and fake review detection. The following are the key results:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Accuracy:} The models achieved an overall accuracy of over 90% on the test dataset, indicating their effectiveness in classifying reviews.
\item \textbf{Precision and Recall:} The precision and recall scores for detecting fake reviews were above 0.85, indicating that the models were able to identify deceptive reviews with high accuracy.
\item \textbf{F1 Score:} The F1 score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, was around 0.90, demonstrating the models' ability to balance precision and recall.
\end{itemize}

\section{Comparison with Baseline Models}
The performance of the developed models was compared with baseline models such as Naïve Bayes and Logistic Regression. The results showed that the developed models outperformed the baseline models in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall.

\section{Feature Importance}
Feature importance analysis was performed to identify the most influential features in detecting fake reviews. The analysis revealed that certain words and phrases, such as "not recommended," "poor quality," and "waste of money," were strong indicators of deceptive reviews.

\section{Analysis of Misclassified Reviews}
An analysis of misclassified reviews was conducted to understand the limitations of the models. It was found that reviews containing sarcastic or nuanced language were more challenging for the models to classify correctly.

\section{Real-World Application}
The models were deployed in a real-world e-commerce platform to automatically detect and filter fake reviews. The deployment resulted in improved credibility and trustworthiness of reviews on the platform, leading to increased user satisfaction and trust.
