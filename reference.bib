@article{Doan2017,
	abstract = {This paper investigates the outage performance of cognitive spectrum-sharing multi-relay networks in which the relays operate in a full-duplex (FD) mode and employ the decode-and-forward (DF) protocol. Two relay selection schemes, i.e., partial relay selection (PRS) and optimal relay selection (ORS), are considered to enhance the system performance. New exact expressions for the outage probability (OP) in both schemes are derived based on which an asymptotic analysis is carried out. The results show that the ORS strategy outperforms PRS in terms of OP, and increasing the number of FD relays can significantly improve the system performance. Moreover, novel analytical results provide additional insights for system design. In particular, from the viewpoint of FD concept, the primary network parameters (i.e., peak interference at the primary receivers, number of primary receivers, and their locations) should be carefully considered since they significantly affect the secondary network performance.},
